# Data Science Assignments Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Assignments Repository! This repository contains a collection of my assignments and projects completed during my journey in learning data science. Each assignment is carefully crafted to cover various aspects of data science, including Machine Learning, Statistics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Time Series Analysis.


## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of my data science assignments, designed to showcase my learning progress and the application of various data science techniques. Each assignment includes a detailed problem statement, the dataset used, and the solution with code and explanations. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the different topics within data science. Each directory contains multiple assignments relevant to that topic

## Topics Covered

### 1. Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation and Selection
- Feature Engineering

### 2. Statistics
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics
- Hypothesis Testing
- Probability Distributions
- Bayesian Statistics

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Preprocessing
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Language Models

### 4. Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Transfer Learning

### 5. Time Series Analysis
- Time Series Decomposition
- Forecasting Models
- ARIMA Models
- Seasonal Adjustments
- Anomaly Detection


```

## Requirements

Each assignment may have different requirements. Generally, you will need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for Deep Learning assignments)
- NLTK or SpaCy (for NLP assignments)
- Statsmodels (for Time Series assignments)


```

## Usage

Navigate to the directory of the assignment you want to work on and follow the instructions provided in the README file of that assignment. Each assignment directory typically contains:

- **Problem Statement:** Detailed description of the assignment task.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used for the assignment or a link to download it.
- **Solution:** The Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the solution.
